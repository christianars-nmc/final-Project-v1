            <div class="cont">
                <p>Micro Beach is a great spot because of the variety of fish that can be caught here. Best way to fish 
                    here is using a bait and wait setup or lure fishing with condoms for Trevallies. It is best to go here 
                    before sunrise or sunset for the best chance of getting a bite. With Micro Beach being a popular spot 
                    there could be people swimming or plenty of people already there fishing. So get there early for 
                    the best chance to get a spot.

        <h2 class="title"><span class="num">2.</span> Inos. Peace Park</h2>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>Inos Peace Park not only a great place to walk/jog but also a great place to go fishing! 
                    Just like Micro Beach there are a lot of fish to catch. It is best to use bait and wait setups
                    and lure fishing. But I do not recommended using lures here if you are a beginner because you 
                    can get easily snagged on rocks and coral with will ultimatly make you lose your lure.

        <h2 class="title"><span class="num">3.</span> Garapan Fishing Base</h2>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>Garapan Fishing Base is an anglers dream spot. Not just a fishing spot but also a pier 
                    used for boats. Good amount of fish can be caught here but just like Inos. Peace Park 
                    you can get easily snagged because of the coral and rocks.
